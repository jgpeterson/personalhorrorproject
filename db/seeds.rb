Crafted by big-budget music-video maker Marcus Nispel and produced by blockbuster action director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock), it has every bit of the visual flair those names suggest. The stars, from lead Jessica Biel (best known for TV’s “Seventh Heaven”) on down, are charismatic. Though not a big-budget film by today’s standards, there are plenty of greenbacks to be seen in the effects. And yet, this new TCM captures the spirit of the original, and exceeds it in more ways than just budget. At its best, it is a gritty, dirty, bloody film filled with suspense and its share of scares. At its worst, it is a gritty, dirty, bloody film filled with suspense and its share of scares that isn’t Hooper’s original. The key to TCM is the characters, and for once, the inevitable comparisons favor the remake. Biel, all-American pretty, provides a strong center for the film. And the young actors playing her four road-tripping friends also create believable characters: Eric Balfour (TV’s “Six Feet Under”) as the leader, Biel’s boyfriend; Erica Leerhsen (Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2) as a free-spirited hitchhiker; Mike Vogel in the best friend role; and Jonathan Tucker (The Virgin Suicides) as the skeptic fifth wheel, playing a variation of the original’s annoying wheelchair-bound brother. Ermey, the most recognizable face in the film, and a fan favorite since his classic performance as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, is both a blessing and curse. While he uses every bit of his quirks, facial expressions and vocal intensity as Sheriff Hoyt, he has almost become a parody of himself and at times borders on the ridiculous — especially in contrast to the often-subtle performances from the younger stars. That can lend to the surreal atmosphere of the kids’ predicament, but at times, it can push viewers’ suspension of disbelief to the limit. This is an outstanding horror movie, one of the best of recent years. Put aside your preconceived notions and appreciate this version of TCM for what it is: a terrific film."})
